\caption{A template for sentences in the artificial language. Each sentence fills the obligatory positions 1, 3, and 6 with a word: a quantifier, noun, and verb. Optional positions (2, 4 and 5) are filled by either a word (adjective, postmodifier or negation) or by the empty string. Closed-class categories (Quantifiers, adjectives, post modifiers and negation) do not include novel words, while  open-class categories (nouns and verbs) includes novel words that are only exposed in the test set.
